### 3. Product
The company's products are all seasonal, with sales growing greatly nearly the end of the year.

## IV. Insights
- From 2011 until the end of 2014, sales generally increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.01%. However, sales generally rises year over year over all categories until the fourth quarter, at which point it falls suddenly in the first quarter of the next year.
- Over the past four years, the gross profit margin remained stable at 11%.
- The B2C customers group provides the most revenue for the organization (48%), followed by Corporate (33%) and Home Office (17%). However, in recent years, revenue from this group has declined slightly. The revenue structure in 2014 shows that the Home Office customer group tends to increase.
 	
## V. Recommendations
- Find an effective business development plan by researching why revenue frequently decreases at the beginning of the year.
- Continue to promote business strategies in major markets like APAC and the EU, while also growing and exploring development methods for future areas with strong CAGRs like Canada and Africa. This is a massive market in the United States, but it also has a large amount of inertia. As a result, a new business plan is needed to promote revenue growth.
- Promote marketing activities in the third and fourth quarters of every year, focusing on potential products (low sales but high profit margin) such as Accessories, Art, Papers, Evelopes, in addition to products in the Phones, Bookcases, Copier, and Chair is inherently the company's strength.
- Promote upselling and cross-selling to boost order value.
